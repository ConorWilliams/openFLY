Welcome to openFLY, the open-source on-the-fly kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) framework.

OpenFLY provides libraries and programs to run massively-parallel on-the-fly KMC simulations. 

OpenFLY was originally developed at the University of Cambridge's department of Materials Science & Metallurgy. It draws inspiration from the atomistic simulation packages `LAMMPS <https://www.lammps.org>`_ and  `HOOMD-blue <https://github.com/joaander/hoomd-blue>`_

OpenFLY is now developed on `GitHub <https://github.com/ConorWilliams/openFLY>`_, where you can ask question and join in the development. This documentation is built automatically and is for the latest development-version of the code. If needed, you can build a local copy of this site, for any version, by following the :ref:`guide <Building>`.

This documentation is organized into three parts: 

1. The :ref:`User guide` for how to install and use openFLY.

2. The :ref:`Programmer guide` for how to write programs using the libFLY library.

3. The :ref:`Library API reference` which serves as information for developers to learn more about openFLYâ€™s internals and as reference for programmers using libFLY.
