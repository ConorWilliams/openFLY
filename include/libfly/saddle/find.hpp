 *
 * @brief Class to coordinate a group of saddle-point searches.
 *
 *
 * \rst
 *
 * Saddle point (SP) searching is an involved process below is an outline of the stages:
 * 
 * 1. For each central atom ``i`` in the input the following steps are carried out.
 * 2. Saddle point searches are carried out (in batches) until a stopping criterion (one of: reconstruction failure, consecutive failed search limit or hitting a total search limit) is reached. Each SP search requires the following series of steps. 
 * 3. A random perturbation of atomic positions and the dimer axis (centred on ``i``)  is made. 
 * 4. The dimer method is used to move the perturbed state to a SP of the potential. It uses a ``cache`` of previously discovered saddle points (SPs)to avoid previous SPs by cancelling the search if the angle between the current search and the historical SP falls below ``theta``. The angle ``theta`` is a decaying function of the number of SP searches.  
 * 5. It is ensured that the maximally displaced atom is ``i`` and the minimally displaced atom is frozen (if there are translational degrees of freedom).
 * 6. The LBFGS minimiser is used to find the adjacent minima, due to freezing the atom in the previous step we can guarantee no translation in the ``min->sp->min`` pathway.
 * 7. It is ensured than the pathway starts at the initial basin and that all the stationary points are distinct points in space. 
 * 8. A local mechanism is constructed from the displacements of the atoms around the central atom. 
 * 9. It is ensured that the local mechanism can be reconstructed in the orientation and location it was discovered. If not it is marked as a poisoned mechanism.
 * 10. It is ensured that the mechanism has not been encountered before.
 * 11. The set of mechanisms related by the symmetries of the local environment are constructed and it is ensured that when these mechanisms are reconstructed the energy barriers are accurate.
 *
