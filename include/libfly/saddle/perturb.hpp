   * @brief Provide a random perturbation to every atom within r_cut of a point.
   *
   * Uses the minimum image distance to determine distance from centre. The perturbation is Gaussian in each coordinate axis and has
   * standard deviation ``stddev``. An envelope function will linearly decrease the size of each atoms perturbation based off its
   * distance to the centre. The axis will be normalised as appropriate. Frozen atoms will not be perturbed.
   *
   * \rst
   * .. tip::
   *    This function uses an expensive method for computing the minimum image convention. If calling this many times on the same
   *    initial condition it may be more efficient to compute and re-use a neighbour list.
   *
   * \endrst
   *
   * @param out Output the perturbed state and randomised axis here.
   * @param urbg Random number generator.
   * @param box Simulation space.
   * @param centre Origin of perturbation.
   * @param cell Input parameters.
   * @param r_cut All atoms within ``r_cut`` of ``centre`` will be perturbed.
   * @param stddev Standard deviation of Gaussian perturbations.
