   * @brief A class to contain, build and manage neighbour lists in shared memory.
   *
   * Neighbour-lists are used to find the atoms within some cut-off of all atoms efficiently. The cache
   * efficiency of all List's major operations can be enhances by pre-sorting the atoms according to their
   * grid index, this can be done with the fly::neigh::sort() function.
   *
   * Designed with the intention of being reused; List separates the building, updating and using of the
   * neighbour-lists, performed by List::rebuild(), List::update() and List::for_neighbours() respectively.
   *
   * List resolves periodicity using *ghost* atoms, these are stored and managed internally.
   *
   * \rst
   *
   * .. admonition:: Implementation notes
   *
   *    Construction of a neighbour-list occurs as follows:
   *
   *    1. Real atoms are mapped into the canonical cell.
   *    2. Ghost atoms are generated.
   *    3. All atoms are linked into lists of atoms in the same grid-cell.
   *    4. Iterating over all adjacent grid-cells the neighbour-lists or real atoms are built.
   *
   *    The neighbour-lists contain the indexes of the real or ghost atoms. Alongside each atom we store the
   *    index of the real atom it may be an image of, this allows us to map ghost atoms to real atoms.
