Welcome to openFLY, the on-the-fly kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) framework.

OpenFLY provides libraries and programs to run massivly parallel on-the-fly KMC simulations. OpenFLY is modelled on `LAMMPS <https://docs.lammps.org/Manual.html#>`_ and was originally developed at the University of Cambridge's Department of Materials Science & Metallurgy. It was designed to run efficiently on parallel computers. OpenFLY is an open-source code, distributed freely under the terms of the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 (GPL-2.0).

OpenFLY is developed on `GitHub <https://github.com/ConorWilliams/openFLY>`_, this documentation is for the development version of the code. If needed, you can build a local copy of this site, for any version, by following the :ref:`guide <Building>`.

This site is organized in three parts: 

1. The :ref:`User guide` for how to install and use openFLY.

2. The :ref:`Programmer guide` for how to write programs using the libFLY library.

3. The :ref:`Library API reference` which serves as information for developers to learn more about openFLYâ€™s internals and as reference for programmers using libFLY.

Once you are familiar with LAMMPS, you may want to bookmark this page since it gives quick access the documentation for all LAMMPS commands.
